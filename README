Pillman game in 512 bytes (boot sector or COM file)

This a game about a yellow man eating pills in 512 bytes. It can be
run as a COM file or put into a boot sector of a floppy disk to be
run.

Move with arrow keys, press Esc to exit (only COM file).

It's compatible with 8088 (the original IBM PC). So you now have
to look for a 8-bit compatible VGA card if you want to run it over
original hardware ;)

A small video of the game running under emulation:

If you want to assemble it, you must download the Netwide Assembler
(nasm) from www.nasm.us

Use this command line:

  nasm -f bin pillman.asm -Dcom_file=1 -o pillman.com
  nasm -f bin pillman.asm -Dcom_file=0 -o pillman.img

Tested with VirtualBox for Mac OS X running Windows XP running this
game, it also works with DosBox and probably with qemu:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -fda pillman.img

Enjoy it!
